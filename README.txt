This program implements the LRU cache, as well as the ideal cache
There are two targets in this program:
Cache - For user calls
Test - To call tests

Cache:
The first number - the Cache Size
The second number - the number of elements
Next numbers, the number of which is equal to the second number - elements

Test:
The first number is the number of tests
Further as in Cache, but two numbers are added in front, whis are expected numbers in LFU cache and ideal cache

It is expected that the files will not be moved to the project repository.
